# Significant features in C++11,14,17


## 1. Deadlocking behavior for [Win32-EnterCriticalSection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-entercriticalsection#remarks) & [std::mutex::lock](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex/lock) (C++11)

- EnterCriticalSection : After a thread has ownership of a critical section, it can make additional calls to EnterCriticalSection or TryEnterCriticalSection without blocking its execution. This prevents a thread from deadlocking itself while waiting for a critical section that it already owns. 

- std::mutex::lock : If lock is called by a thread that already owns the mutex, the behavior is undefined. An implementation that can detect the invalid usage is encouraged to throw a std::system_error with error condition resource_deadlock_would_occur instead of deadlocking.

So, additional calls to EnterCriticalSection in owner thread is fine(no throw, no deadlocking). But for std::mutex::lock, we will probably get a exception(for windows STL, it's "device or resource busy").

After all, additional locks in the owner thread is definitely wrong. We should check our codes and redesign them(maybe unnecessary lock).

## 2. [Node handle](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex/lock) for associative containers (C++17)
